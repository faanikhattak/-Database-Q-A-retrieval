This project focuses on creating a robust system for querying a MySQL database and generating natural language responses based on the query results. Using LangChain, the system utilizes a few-shot learning approach to generate accurate SQL queries from user questions. By integrating HuggingFace embeddings and Ollama's LLM, the system can understand and translate natural language queries into SQL commands. The project also includes error handling to ensure smooth execution. This solution is ideal for applications requiring dynamic data retrieval and reporting, such as inventory management, where users can query and receive insightful responses about stock levels and sales.
